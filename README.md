# Predicting-House-Price

House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
So to deal with this kind of issues Today we will be preparing a MACHINE LEARNING Based model, trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset.

Importing Libraries and Dataset:
Here we are using 

Pandas – To load the Dataframe
Matplotlib – To visualize the data features i.e. barplot
Seaborn – To see the correlation between features using heatmap

The dataset contains 13 features :

1  | 	Id	         |    To count the records.
2  | 	MSSubClass	 |  Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.
3	 |  MSZoning	   |   Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.
4  |	LotArea	     |   Lot size in square feet.
5	 |  LotConfig	   |  Configuration of the lot
6	 |  BldgType	   |   Type of dwelling
7	 |  OverallCond	 |   Rates the overall condition of the house
8  |	YearBuilt	   |    Original construction year
9  |	YearRemodAdd |   Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions).
10 |  Exterior1st  | 	Exterior covering on house
11 |  BsmtFinSF2	 |   Type 2 finished square feet.
12 |  TotalBsmtSF	 |  Total square feet of basement area
13 |  SalePrice	   |   To be predicted
